# Overview
NepalEHR is an open source electronic health record system that allows for digital storage and maintenance of individual patientâ€™s medical records, including supply chain management, simple enough to be used by mid-level practitioners but complex enough to meet demanding population health needs.

NepalEHR brings together multiple well-known open source platforms under one well-designed user interface:
* [OpenMRS](http://openmrs.org/): Open source medical records system
* [OpenELIS](http://openelis.org/): Open source lab information system
* [OpenERP/Odoo](http://odoo.com): Open source inventory and resources management tool
* [DCM4Che](/http://www.dcm4che.org/): Open source clinical image and object management
